# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs to filter a table with multiple criteria and display the filtered UFO sightings data.

## Results
The webpage can be filtered by 5 diffrent criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and UFO Shape.

### Filter by Date
To filter by date the user will input a date (like the 1/1/2010 placeholder shows) and the webpage will then filter the data based on the new criteria.

### Filter by City
To filter by City the user will input a city (like the "eugene" placeholder shows) and the webpage will then filter the data based on the new criteria.

### Filter by State
To filter by State the user will input a state (like the "or" placeholder shows) and the webpage will then filter the data based on the new criteria.

## Summary 
One drawback of the filters is specifically with UFO shape. Some possible search criteria for shape are "light", "unknown", "fireball", and "sphere", all of which aren't commonly known and the user would probably have to scroll through the table to find out what the possible UFO shapes to filter by are. Two reccomendations for further development would be a dropdown menu for each filter to provide possible criteria, and a nice reset button to be able to quickly clear all of the filters applied to reset the table.
